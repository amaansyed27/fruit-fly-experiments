# Experiment 001 — Pong

## Hypothesis

Activity propagated through the fixed MaleCNS v1.0 connectome may produce above-random sensorimotor behavior when pixel-derived visual activity is injected into mapped visual neurons and bilateral steering-descending activity controls a Pong paddle.

## Method

- Retain MaleCNS neurons with a non-empty `superclass`, excluding explicit glia: expected **166,700 neurons**.
- Retain all released directed edges between those neurons: expected **25,582,938 edges / 124,177,617 synaptic contacts**.
- Use synapse count as connection strength; GABA, glutamate and histamine are treated as inhibitory proxies, then each postsynaptic neuron's absolute incoming weights are normalized.
- Render an egocentric Pong sensor image and rotate its control axis into the fly's horizontal visual axis.
- Drive mapped L1/R7/R8 optic-column neurons from luminance/motion and LC10a from coarse pixel motion. No internal `ball_y`, ball velocity, or target coordinate enters the controller.
- Run the full fixed sparse graph with simplified leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics.
- Read bilateral activity from steering-related DNs (`DNa01`, `DNa02`, `DNa03`, `DNa11`, `DNb02`, `DNg13`). Right-minus-left activity is translated to DOWN/UP; a deadband yields NEUTRAL.

## Controls

`--controller random` is the V0.1 chance baseline. No learning or plasticity is enabled.

## Metrics

Score, rally duration, action distribution, output activity, brain-step latency, FPS, and run-level hit/score proxies. Use multiple seeds for comparisons.

## Results

Behavioral results are not committed yet. Run logs are intentionally gitignored; analyze locally with `python scripts/analyze_pong.py <run.csv>`.

### Local performance benchmark

Measured on Amaan's Windows laptop with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU using the full retained MaleCNS graph (**166,700 neurons, 25,582,938 edges**):

| Device | Median brain step | Mean brain step | Steps/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU | 20.675 ms | 20.823 ms | 48.0 |
| RTX 5060 Laptop GPU (CUDA 13.0) | 1.735 ms | 1.761 ms | 568.0 |

The CUDA path is about **11.8× faster** by measured steps/s. PyTorch currently reports sparse CSR support as beta; the warning is informational and the benchmark completed successfully.

## Limitations

The wiring, neuron IDs, annotations and synapse-count-derived strengths are biological data. Point-neuron dynamics, neurotransmitter sign simplification, frame-to-vision mapping, 90° control-axis rotation, LC10a motion drive, and the Pong mapping of steering laterality to vertical paddle movement are engineered assumptions. This is not a biologically exact digital fly.
